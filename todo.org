** TODO Find location of illegal instruction bug in TF 2.4.0

This crashes on the Rechenknecht, but not on the other two machines (which have newer CPUs)
Therefore, the bug must be caused by some instructions being used that don't exist on Broadwell CPUs, but do later.

This is mentioned here:
[[https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/45744][Illegal instruction (core dumped) in a CPU with AVX support #45744]]
